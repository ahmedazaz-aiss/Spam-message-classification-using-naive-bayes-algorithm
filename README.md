# Spam message classification using naive bayes algorithm
#### I undertook this project to enhance my understanding of text classification techniques in NLP. The objective was to classify SMS messages as either spam or non-spam using the Naive Bayes algorithm.

#### Spam message classification is a common NLP task. The Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic model based on Bayes Theorem, often used for text classification due to its simplicity and efficiency with high-dimensional data. I implemented the Naive Bayes classifier using Python, with a focus on preprocessing steps like tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction (TF-IDF). I evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using precision and recall, refining the model to improve accuracy. This project allowed me to develop a solid understanding of machine learning, text preprocessing, and evaluation metrics for text classification.
